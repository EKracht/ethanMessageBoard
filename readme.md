This is my CRUD app message board.

This will allow you to add to the message board, remove messages, and edit message rows. It will also update your time with the time of your edit.

It uses express and mongo for the backend and jquery for the front end.

The info will be saved until you delete or edit it thanks to mongodb.

Have a nice day.
